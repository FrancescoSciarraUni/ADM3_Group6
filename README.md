# Homework 3 - Group 6

In this repository, you can find all you need to implement a search engine over *Top Anime Series* from the list of [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net).


This assignment is organized in 3 main sections.

##### * `data_collection.py`
> It is a python script which contains the functions that are needed to collect our data for the search engine. 
> 
> Specifically we used them to get all the links from the list of Anime and then to scrape the collected web pages which have been stored in files called `article.html` that we organized in different [pages](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/438cskrhjvsiu7b/AACmUnbGSLzRo-KMa0BKocXGa?dl=0).


* `linksfile.txt`
> It contains the links of all the Anime in the list.

* `tsv_management.py`
> This script contains some useful functions which we used to create and manipulate our data from our *linksfile* list. We have obtained one file with extention `tsv` for each *article.htlm*
